What a journey! 

This week I have completed my second portfolio project for the curriculum, LOCALE, a simple Sinatra-CMS web application that allows users to add there favorite places to eat and drink as well as see other users favorite spots!  This process was a struggle but in the best way possible.  It was eye opening to see in the most simple of ways what goes in to developing an application and the process a developer has to go through in doing so.  Particularly what stood out, were the routes that a user takes through your application, and as a developer making sure that you are giving that specific user the correct degree of access to certain files in your application.  For example, you don't want to allow a user to delete another users destinations or be able to log in without the correct email.  
During this project I found that it was super helpful to plan the structure of my app beforehand,  it helped me establish the flow that I wanted the user to take through the app, hopefully allowing for a pleasant user experience.  I am super grateful to have made it through this far, and this is just the tip of the iceberg! Can't wait to look back on this project one day and see how far I've come! 

Cheers ya'll!
